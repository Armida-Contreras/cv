      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am Armida Contreras, a passionate and skilled web designer and developer with a strong eye for detail and a
        knack for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I have a deep understanding of front-end web
        development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience with popular frameworks and
        libraries like React and Bootstrap.</p>
		<p>I also have a background in Embedded System Engineering. With my strong technical skills and creative mindset, I have successfully developed and designed a cash payment kiosk with a monitoring system. This project involved designing the user interface, implementing payment functionalities, and integrating hardware components for seamless operation.</p>
      <p>Throughout my career, I have worked on various projects, collaborating with clients to understand their
        requirements and deliver high-quality websites that align with their vision. I am constantly exploring new
        trends and techniques in web design to stay updated and enhance my skills.</p>
      <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new breakthrough innovation with internet of things, experimenting with photography, or
        immersing myself in a good book. I believe in continuous learning and personal growth, and I am always excited
        to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving field of technology.</p>
